## 🤖 AI Features

AI generation and AI analysis require a free Groq API key.

1. Get a free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
2. Click the **API Key** button in the top-right corner of the app
3. Paste your key and click **Save & Verify**

The key is stored only in your browser's `localStorage` — it is never sent anywhere except directly to Groq.

## 🔄 How It Works

### Survey Flow
1. **Build** — add questions in the builder, or generate with AI
2. **Share** — copy the share link and send it to respondents
3. **Analyse** — view charts and AI insights in the analytics panel

### Data Storage
Everything is stored in three `localStorage` keys:
- `surveysphere_surveys` — all survey objects
- `surveysphere_responses` — all response data, keyed by survey ID
- `surveysphere_api_key` — your Groq API key

> ⚠️ Since data lives in the browser, each device/browser instance has its own isolated data. For shared persistent storage, a backend (Firebase, Supabase) would be needed.
